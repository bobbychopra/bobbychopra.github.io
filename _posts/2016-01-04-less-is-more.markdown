I've been programming in C-style (C, C++, C#) like programming languages for most of my professional career. The amount of code one has to write and the amount of white space being used seems a lot more compared to the ML family of languages like F#, OCaml. These languages are strongly-typed, concise and feel far superior and prevent many errors some commonly caused by re-assigning variables, unhandled exceptions caused by null references.

I love the succintness of the ML family of languages, as a result one has to write far less code. This should be treated as a hugh positive. It helps with code readability and has the ability to do a lot more by writing a lot less code.


*NOTE: Professionals writing software using a less powerful language will always produce a better product than unprofessionals developing using the most powerful programming languages.*
