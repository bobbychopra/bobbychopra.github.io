Contrary to what many think, a Buy-Side firm is not a company that buys securities and a Sell-Side firm is not someone selling those securities.

Both Buy-Side and Sell-Side firms buy and sell securities. The difference is who provides the liquidity i.e. a Sell-Side firm provides or sells liquidity, while Buy-Side firms buys the liquidity. Providing liquidity means being able to provide a price for the securities.

Banks such as Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America are common Sell-Side firms, while Institutional Clients, Mutual Fund Companies, Hedge Funds such as Fidelity, Citadel, Jane Street are normally classified as Buy-Side firms.
